# Weather Report
hosted [here](https://zbelouchi.github.io/weather-app/) via GitHub Pages

a weather forecasting web application built using React JS and bundled with Vite.

## Notes:
* Weather forecasts may not be 100% accurate as the API used only updates every few hours, While not updating in real time, Open-Meteo was the best free weather API I could find for a demo project
* I don't have in depth knowledge of the geocoding api, so some locations might break the application if selected. I did add a filter so this won't happen, but some may have slipped through without me catching them as there are many
